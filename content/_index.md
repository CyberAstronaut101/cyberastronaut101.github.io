MASON COMPUTERS spawned in 2014 when I started my development journey with a HTML/JS class on Udemy. I was hooked to say the least, and since then I have had a wide range of experiences that have shaped me into the maker I am today.

I have recently graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science, and now have found time to finish the pile of projects I have started on but never finished due to having to focus on school. I am currently working on a few projects, and will be posting them here as I finish them.
