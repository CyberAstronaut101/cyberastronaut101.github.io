      <description>MASON COMPUTERS spawned in 2014 when I began my journey into computer programming. Now that I am about to graduate with my B.S. in Computer Science with a focus in Cyber Security, the time has come to give this site a purpose.
Interested in All Things Tech. If something has electricity flowing, there is a good chance that I have experience tinkering with it.
During my extended time at home due to COVID-19, I have found myself picking up forgotten projects.</description>
